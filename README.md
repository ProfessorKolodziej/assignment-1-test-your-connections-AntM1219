# Hello, world!

Today, we'll build on our knowledge of HTML tags by making our first changes to HTML, and practice using our new knowledge of GitHub.

## Requirements

- [ ] Change the title of the page to "Hello, world!"
- [ ] Add a paragraph in the first line of the body tag with the text "Hello, world!", using the `<p>` tag.
- [ ] Add another paragraph telling us who you are, and what you're looking forward to most in this class.
- [ ] After class, choose one HTML element that interests you from [the MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to introduce to the class. Use the snippet below to get started:
	```
		<h2>My favorite new HTML element</h2>
		<!-- This is a comment. It helps provide instructions, and doesn't show in final HTML. You can delete it if you want, and replace this with what your favorite HTML element is, and why. Hint: if you want to show your HTML element like a tag in the text, like in the example, you may need to escape the HTML element using a tool like https://www.freeformatter.com/html-escape.html -->
		<h3>How to use this element</h3>
		<code>
			<!-- Try adding an example of how to use your HTML element here. You can use MDN's examples as a starting point. -->
		</code>
		<p>All information is from <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">MDN docs</a></cite></p>
	```

## First: What is HTML?



### New terms

- **Tag:** A piece of HTML code that helps a computer understand the meaning of your content. Different tags have different meanings, and tags have a **syntax** that helps a computer understand where that meaning starts and ends, like so: `<tag-name>your content</tag-name>`. For example, an h1 tag means that the content inside is the main heading for the page, and looks like `<h1>Your Title Here</h1>`.
- **Syntax:** A special set of rules for how to write code that tells a computer how to read the code. Each language has its own syntax.

## Instructions

These instructions will build on your knowledge by having you practice the same set of skills you learned in Test Your Connections, but without the step by step screenshots. See if you can remember how to do each step without the help of the screenshots. If you are having trouble or getting stuck, head over to the Test Your Connections assignment instructions for a reminder.

### 1. Clone this repository and find it on your computer

1. Use the "Open with Github Desktop" button to open this repository in Tower.
2. When the window opens in Tower, choose Clone.
3. In Tower, click Repositories, then select your repository, then click "Open".
4. On the screen that appears, right click Working Copy, then select **Reveal in Finder** to show the location of the folder on your computer.

### 2. Open the folder in VSCode, and make a change to the HTML

1. Drag and drop the folder from the window that appears into VSCode.
2. Read the requirements above carefully. Then, use the information in the requirements to make a change to your code.
3. Save your changes.

### 3. Commit and push your changes to GitHub

1. Open Tower, and make sure you are in your Repository view, and that you've clicked "Working Copy".
2. Click “Stage All”.
3. Write a commit message in the Commit Subject area. Keep it short and descriptive of the changes you made.
4. Hit “Commit”. This creates a commit, and your changes will “disappear”.
5. Look for a small arrow with a number next to your **branch**. This is how many changes you will be pushing. Click the small up arrow to push your changes to GitHub.

### 4. New: Open a pull request on GitHub for feedback

| Step | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| Open Tower, and make sure you are in your Repository view, and that you've clicked "Working Copy". <ol><li>Click “Stage All”</li><li>Write a commit message in the Commit Subject area. Keep it short and descriptive of the changes you made.</li><li>Hit “Commit”. This creates a commit, and your changes will “disappear”.</li></ol> | ![image9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1828613/130551912-d3ffbeca-089d-4311-a2de-d82258eb9676.png) | 
| This is what that "disappearing" will look like. Don't panic, your changes are still there! You can see they are because now there will be a small arrow with a number. This is how many changes you will be pushing. It's time to **push** your changes. Click the small up arrow to push your changes to GitHub. | ![image6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1828613/130552156-9fd93037-8f3d-479f-a314-40e1d18ee5f8.png) | 

## 5. New: Check Autograding to see how you did!

This repository uses Autograding to check the basic assignment requirements. Once you pass these requirements, [send me a link to the pull request in Blackboard](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=825). I'll give you additional feedback on things like performance and coding style, so you know how to improve your code for next time.

[Learn more about Autograding in this video](https://mymedia.bu.edu/media/Put+it+All+TogetherA+Blackboard%2C+Github%2C+Glitch/1_66r1kz2n?st=676)
