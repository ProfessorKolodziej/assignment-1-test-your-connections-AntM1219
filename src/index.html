	<h1 class="page-heading">How to use a professional web development workflow</h1>
	<h2>What do professional web development workflows usually have?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A text editor (VSCode or other text editor of your choice)</li>
		<li>A version control system (Git/Github)</li>
		<li>A way to access that version control system (Command line, Tower)</li>
		<li>A package manager (such as npm), which requires <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> to be installed</li>
		<li>Build tools that let you use the latest and greatest technology, which makes your life easier (Linters such as Stylelint and ESLint, compilers such as Sass, Babel, and Webpack)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Most importantly, these tools are here to <strong>help and support you!</strong> You don't need to be an expert in them or even really understand them. There are people whose entire jobs are to put together tooling like this. That's not your job in this class, and that's why you're going to use a <strong>modern boilerplate</strong> so you don't have to do that work. <strong>You can write the exact same HTML and CSS you're used to in this boilerplate if you want - but this template will allow you to explore some helpful new additions to your web development toolkit.</strong></p>
	<h2>A basic introduction to Sass (SCSS)</h2>
	<p>Whoa. What's <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide">Sass</a>? It's a preprocessor for CSS. It adds some really helpful tools that help you stay sane when you're writing more complicated CSS. The standard syntax for Sass is called SCSS, and it is written so that you can write plain old CSS - just like you're used to now! - right in an scss file, or you can use some new, helpful tools, like variables.</p>
	<p>We're only going to learn the helpful parts of Sass in this class: <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-4">partials</a>, <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-2">variables</a>, <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-3">nesting</a>, and inline media queries.</p>
	<p>This starter template allows you to work in Sass if you like. We won't be learning a lot of Sass in class, but you are welcome to explore it on your own. The file extension for Sass is <em>scss</em>. Whether you choose to use Sass or not, you will be writing your styles in the src/css/styles.scss file.</p>
	<p>Technically, Sass is a compiled language. That means it goes through a preprocessor, and becomes regular CSS at the end. This template takes care of the build process for you, so you can explore using Sass if you want to organize your CSS into smaller, more manageable chunks.</p>
	<p>I personally love Sass - it makes my life so much easier! I wrote the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-7">Extend/Inhertiance</a> part of the Sass documentation. So as you can tell, Sass means a lot to me! But it is also an industry standard, so it is good for you to be aware of it. Don't feel like you have to learn it all - or even any of it! Only use the parts that help your team.</p>
	<h3>Steps to complete</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Resize this browser. What is changing at each breakpoint?</li>
		<li>Look at src/css/styles.scss. What is new about what you see? What looks familiar?</li>
		<li>Examine each new element one at a time. What is it for? Where is it coming from?</li>
		<li>Change one color variable.</li>
		<li>Add a new partial for your homepage styles.</li>
	</ol>
